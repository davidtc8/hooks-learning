# Intro to React

## What is this repo about?
This repo is for all those who are just getting started with react, I find this repo valuable 
because we review the following hooks:
- useState            # How to pass data to different components
- useEffect           # Trigger a certain function after the application has already rendered
- useRef              # Mutable values that does not cause a re-render
- useLayoutEffect     # Sincronous hook that happens after react executed all its mutations
- useMemo             # Cache a component
- useReducer          # Separate the state management from the rendering
- useContext          # Passing data through components without using props.
- Custom Hooks        # We also build our own custom hooks
