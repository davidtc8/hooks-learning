# Hooks in React

## What is this repo about?
This repo is for all those who are just getting started with react, I find this repo valuable 
because we review the following hooks:
- **useState**
    - How to pass data to different components
- **useEffect**
    - Trigger a certain function after the application has already rendered
- **useRef**
    - Mutable values that does not cause a re-render
- **useLayoutEffect**
    - Sincronous hook that happens after react executed all its mutations
- **useMemo**      
    - Cache a component
- **useReducer**
    - Separate the state management from the rendering
- **useContext**     
    - Passing data through components without using props.
- **Custom Hooks**  
    - We also build our own custom hooks
